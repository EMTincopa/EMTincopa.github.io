## If you are here...

Well, if you are here maybe you already saw my last post on instagram or twitter.

[Dataviz Adventure](https://twitter.com/DatavizAdventuR)
`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 1433948777900134402 >}}")`

This time I wanted to try two different tools for the same dataset _*"Entry-level" jobs require 3+ years of experience*_ from the #MakeOverMonday challenge, week 34.

According to [LinkedIn Economic Graph research](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hirings-new-red-line-why-newcomers-cant-land-35-jobs-george-anders/), an analysis of more than 3.8 million new LinkedIn job postings from December 2017 through August 2021, shows that entry level jobs often demand years of prior experience. As you know, these **entry-level jobs** are normally designed or designated for recent graduates of a given discipline and tipically does not require prior experience in the field or profession.

My below graphs show the results of this study with two different tools.

## Using Highcharter

[Highcharter](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/) is a R package for create dynamic graphics from Highcharts Javascript library and its modules. It is very flexible and customizable. It is really useful because coding online graphics from scratching using JavaScript libraries such as D3 is a pain in the bum :grin:.

The next bar chart was made with the [Highcharter](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/) package for R. This option is incredible because also allow us to easily export the charts we create in R as responsively designed web pages, which can be embedded in other projects through simple iframes.

```{r bars, echo=FALSE}
frameWidget(
  hiring_v2%>%
    hchart(type = "bar",
         hcaes(x = Job, y = Experience_percent),
         color = c("#0D3C38"),
         name = "Entry-level job")%>%
  hc_title(
    text = "<b>Are Entry-Level jobs really Entry-Level?</b>",
    margin = 20,
    align = "left",
    style = list(
      color = "#333333",
      useHTML = TRUE,
      fontSize = "21px",
      fontFamily = "Roboto condensed"
    )
  ) %>%
  hc_subtitle(
    text = "Original article: Entry-level jobs on LinkedIn require 3+ years of experience",
    margin = 20,
    align = "left",
    style = list(
      fontFamily = "Roboto",
      fontSize = "14px",
      color = "#666666"
    )
  ) %>%
  hc_caption(text = "Design: Enrique Mendoza | Source: LinkedIn, #MakeOverMonday week 34, 2021",
             style = list(fontFamily = "Roboto", fontSize = "10px")) %>%
  hc_chart(backgroundColor = "#F6F3EC") %>%
  hc_tooltip(
    crosshairs = TRUE,
    backgroundColor = "#FFC876",
    shared = TRUE,
    borderWidth = 1,
    valueSuffix = " %",
    style = list(fontFamily = "Roboto condensed", fontSize = "14")
  ) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = ""),
           labels = list(
             format = "{value}%",
             style = list(
               fontFamily = "Roboto",
               fontSize = "12px",
               color = "#666666"
             )
           )) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = ""), labels = list(
    style = list(
      fontFamily = "Roboto",
      fontSize = "12px",
      color = "#333333"
    ) 
  )))
```

## Tableau

Tableau is a data analytics and visualization tool used widely in the industry today and you can perform tasks like sorting, comparing and analyzing. Many businesses even consider it indispensable for data science related work and that sort of things :grimacing:. 

The following bar chart was very easy to make, thanks to the fact that it has a drag and drop interface. In many other cases (like dashboards), adding interactivity to a visualization, let you empower others to freely explore the data and form a deeper understanding.

Well, thank you very much for reading this little post, possibly I will continue experimenting with both tools, so just wait for my future posts. By the way, which one did you like the most?, should I do a more detailed tutorial?, Do you have any suggestion?, feel free to answer me on [Instagram](instagram.com/datavizadventure/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DatavizAdventuR).
