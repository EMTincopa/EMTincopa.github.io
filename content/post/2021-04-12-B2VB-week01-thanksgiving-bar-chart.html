<p>For so long I wanted to have an excuse for use Tableau, I’m a Power BI user (just for work), so this <a href="https://www.thetableaustudentguide.com/vizbasics">Back 2 Viz Basics</a> challenge (<strong>#B2VB</strong> on Twitter) created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ReadySetData">Eric Balash</a> is that perfect excuse.</p>
<p>But I didn’t plan just to create one single <a href="https://data.world/back2vizbasics/2021teaser-build-your-best-bar-chart">bar chart for this week challenge</a>, I have planned to make the same bar chart in 3 different ways, using: R + Adobe Illustrator, Highcharts and Tableau.</p>
<p>The <strong>#B2VB</strong> challenge used the <a href="https://www.statista.com/study/24944/thanksgiving-in-the-us-statista-dossier/">Statista Thanksgiving &amp; Holiday Survey 2016 data</a>, where 1,199 individuals were surveyed in U.S. and for each food item, asked if it would be on their Thanksgiving dinner table or not.</p>
<div id="r-adobe-illustrator" class="section level1">
<h1>R + Adobe Illustrator</h1>
<p>These are my everyday tools, I start making the chart in R as much seemed as my initial sketches. When the chart is done, I save it as PDF and inmediatly imported on Adobe Illustrator. I usually change things like color palette, axis, fonts for titles and annotations, and sometimes I add images or granular effect for backgrounds.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">What Americans wants on their Dinner Tables this Year? - B2VB challenge</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="highcharts" class="section level1">
<h1>Highcharts</h1>
<p>In this case I used the R’s package Highcharter (created for dynamic graphics and based on Highcharts Javascript library and its modules). My challenge here was to replicate my previous chart made with <em>R + Adobe illustrator</em> with this library.</p>

<p>I didn’t need to add more dynamic elements to this simple bar chart and the same time I achieved to post it on web without losing image quality.</p>

<div id="tableau" class="section level1">
<h1>Tableau</h1>
<p>With a similar interactivity to the highcharts graphics but with this drag and drop interface, the bar chart was easy to make. I added the same background that I made for my <em>R + Adobe Illustrator</em> bar chart (I like granulate backgrounds :smiley:).</p>
