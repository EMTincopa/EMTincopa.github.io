For so long I wanted to have an excuse for use Tableau, I'm a Power BI user (just for work, I still not feeling comfortable with this software), so this [Back 2 Viz Basics](https://www.thetableaustudentguide.com/vizbasics) challenge (**#B2VB** on Twitter) created by [Eric Balash](https://twitter.com/ReadySetData) is that perfect excuse to deploy my little knowledge about Tableau solving some problems.

But I didn't plan just to create one single [bar chart for this week challenge](https://data.world/back2vizbasics/2021teaser-build-your-best-bar-chart), I have planned to make the same bar chart in 3 different ways, using: R + Adobe Illustrator, Highcharts and Tableau. Let's go.

The **#B2VB** challenge used the [Statista Thanksgiving & Holiday Survey 2016 data](https://www.statista.com/study/24944/thanksgiving-in-the-us-statista-dossier/), where 1,199 individuals were surveyed in U.S. and for each food item, asked if it would be on their Thanksgiving dinner table or not.

# R + Adobe Illustrator

These are my everyday tools, I start making the chart in R as much seemed as my initial sketches. When the chart is done, I save it as PDF and inmediatly imported on Adobe Illustrator. I usually change things like color palette, axis, fonts for titles and annotations, and sometimes I add images or granular effect for backgrounds.

# Highcharts

In this case I use the R package Highcharter (created for dynamic graphics and based on Highcharts Javascript library and its modules). My challenge here was to replicate my previous chart made with R + Adobe illustrator with this library.

````{r bar dynamic, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

thanksgiving%>%
  mutate(Percent_final = Percent*100)%>%
  hchart(type = "bar",
         hcaes(x = Food, y = Percent_final),
         color = c("#BF542C"),
         name = "Percent")%>%
  hc_title(
    text = "<b>What Americans wants on their Dinner Tables this Year?</b>",
    margin = 20,
    align = "left",
    style = list(
      color = "#333333",
      useHTML = TRUE,
      fontSize = "24px",
      fontFamily = "Roboto slab"
    )
  ) %>%
  hc_subtitle(
    text = "<b>1, 199</b> individuals were surveyed in U.S. <i>(Statista Thanksgiving & Holiday Survey 2016)</i> and for each food item, asked if it would be on  their <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner table or not.",
    margin = 20,
    align = "left",
    style = list(
      fontFamily = "Roboto",
      fontSize = "14px",
      color = "#4D4D4D"
    )
  ) %>%
  hc_caption(text = "Design: Enrique Mendoza | IG: datavizadventure | Source: Statista (2016) | #B2VB, Week 01 - Bar Chart",
             style = list(fontFamily = "Roboto", fontSize = "11px", color = "666666")) %>%
  hc_chart(backgroundColor = "#FCECC9") %>%
  hc_tooltip(
    crosshairs = TRUE,
    backgroundColor = "#C7CDA9",
    shared = TRUE,
    borderWidth = 1,
    valueSuffix = " %",
    style = list(fontFamily = "Roboto slab", fontSize = "14")
  ) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = ""),
           labels = list(
             format = "{value}%",
             style = list(
               fontFamily = "Roboto",
               fontSize = "11px",
               color = "#808080"
             )
           )) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = ""), labels = list(
    style = list(
      fontFamily = "Roboto medium",
      fontSize = "12px",
      color = "#4D4D4D"
    ) 
  ))

```

I don't need to add more dynamic elements to this simple bar chart but, achieve to post it on web without lossing image quality. 

# Tableau

With a similar interactivity like highcharts graphics but with this drag and drop interface, the bar chart was easy to make. I just added the same background that I made for my R + Adobe Illustrator bar chart (I like granulate backgrounds :smiley:).
